Techniques for Autonomous Vehicle Object Detection

In my paper, I will cover multiple types of object detections used by autonomous vehicles. One of method that will be covered is synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Another method uses Convolutional Neural Network and a binocular camera to acquire disparity maps. The last one uses lightweight map-enhanced 3D object detection.
