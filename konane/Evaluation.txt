Our evaluation function returns the amount of moves that get generated
    following each move at the max depth. A max player should favor taking
    moves that have a high number of following moves, while a min player
    should favor moves that have a low number of following moves.
We considered other possible heuristics for our evaluation function, but
    ultimately decided to choose a simple one for our player.
This heuristic won in all of our tests against simple players, and in many
    of the tests against random players.
